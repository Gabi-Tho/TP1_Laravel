    <p>No one knows when cheese was first made. The earliest direct evidence of cheesemaking is now being found in clay sieves (holed pottery) over seven thousand years old, for example in Kujawy, Poland,[4] and the Dalmatian coast in Croatia, the latter with dried remains which chemical analysis suggests was cheese.[1][2][3] Shards of holed pottery were also found in Urnfield pile-dwellings on Lake Neuchatel in Switzerland and are hypothesized to be cheese-strainers;[5] they date back to BCE (8,000 years ago).[6]
    For preservation purposes, cheese-making may have begun by the pressing and salting of curdled milk. Animal skins and   inflated internal organs already provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs. Curdling milk in an animal's stomach     made solid and better-textured curds, which could easily have led to the conscious addition of rennet.
